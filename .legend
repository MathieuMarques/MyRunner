enemy will spawn randomly, you can't make them spawn by yourself
maps are made of 18 blocks in height and if you want the ground to look good,
place the grass/spikes on top of dirt block and put nothing over it unless you want your map to be awful.

if you want an example of a map you can look in the map folder.
